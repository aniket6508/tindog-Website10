## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap



### What I learned
I have learned a lot of things in this project like how to use "Bootstrap" and "CSS Grid".  
I learned about "Media Query Breakpoints", which are used to implement a particular CSS styling on the specific conditions. Like if the screen is bigger than 800px use this set of styling etc.
In the end, Angela Yu Taught us how to refract a code.
Refracting a code contains these four steps in priority order:-
1. Readability
2. Modularity
3. Efficiency
4. Length

Some code snippet for fun ðŸ˜€:

```html
<h1>Meet new and interesting dogs nearby.</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: lovelysniffred;
}
```
```js
const labrador = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I want to learn more about "CSS Grid" and "Bootstrap" and also want to learn more about "Media Query Breakpoints" and "Refracting a code".
